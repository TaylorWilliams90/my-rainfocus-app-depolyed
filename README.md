This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You might need to run a npm install ?

I don't know, I have not really done one of these remove node_modules zip files?

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I would have comments and notes throughout the code but where I work currently, 
they are not comments in the app, So I removed the comments that I did make. 
I do tend to try to make thing as readable as possible. I think that is why I like using SCSS 
and in CSS my classes are part of what is going on in the app.
